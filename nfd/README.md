# Node Feature Discovery Operator

The Node Feature Discovery Operator (NFD) manages the detection of hardware features and configuration in an OpenShift Container Platform cluster by labelling the nodes with hardware-specific information.

## Cookbook

* I want to know if a nodes CPU supports a given flag

* I want to know if a given PCI device exists on a node

* I want to know if a given USB device exists on a node

* I want to know if a given storage device exists on a node

* I want to know if a kernel module is loaded on a node

* [I want KMM to load kernel modules based on NFD labels](kmm.md)
